My game will be a simple Frogger style game, where the player spawns on one side and has to reach the other side to pick up the prize/flag to win. There will be moving obstacles along the path, and if the player collides with the obstacles, they will lose the game.

The system I will be using is going to be simple:
-	My controller input system
-	Collision system made by either JOSH BUTNER or PATRICK SPENCER

** At the time of writing this, the two people above have not send their links to their writeup and code, so I cannot decide which one to use, but it will be one of them.
 
The way I will use my system is simple, itâ€™s a controller input system, so I just map the controller input to the movements. And on win or lose, the controller will vibrate in different patterns

My game will be very simple, assets I will need:
-	Player: mesh and shader
-	Target: mesh and shader
-	Obstacle: mesh and shader
-	Win/Lose state screen:  mesh and shader
